## Water quality report presented by Lisa Fast

Water quality report (/water/quality reports/) online

* Thank you to Carole Doré, Denis Corbeil and Rejean Vaillant for their continued volunteer work on water testing. Water testing samples on Lac Notre Dame were collected August 8 (earlier than usual), before the 45mm rainfall that began that night. 

* Rainfall in June and July was higher than usual totals for those months (for example July 2024 had 150mm vs 2023’s 82mm). The rain washes sediments and nutrients into the lake, reducing clarity and creating conditions for next year’s milfoil growth.  
    
* **Toxic Blue-Green Algae** appeared in July for the first time near location 9B. This toxin makes it dangerous to swim, for pets, to use for drinking water even with filters/UV, and even makes boating risky. The nutrients that feed the algae are the same as those that feed the weed. It cannot be removed, only prevented as much as possible. A proposal for an action plan to better communicate prevention and risks is in the works by Jim Thompson.   
  * Septic systems can be a source of nutrients \- check your septic system \-pump it out, have it inspected, repair it.   
  * maintain/enhance/restore your shoreline to a natural state to reduce harmful nutrients from being washed into the lake

Extra E-coli testing in July on Generations:  
* Last year we voted to do extra tests for e-coli in July at usual high-spots on Generations and Symons. This cost $400 ($50 per test x 8 tests), which is not sustainable.   
**\* All tests showed levels well below those required for safe swimming (200 CFU).** As usual, the highest was 72 CFU at location 6 at the end of Generations.   
\* This was a series of 2 tests to assess e-coli levels over July, given previous high levels in that area and 2 in August (the full lake samples in early August and a final test in late August).  
**\*** Given that no unsafe-for-swimming levels were detected in July,  despite low water levels and warm water, no extra tests will be performed in 2025\.  
    
**Lac Notre Dame August 8, 2024 water testing report summary:**
 
* Good news that E-coli at all locations is either below detectable levels or just at the detectable level of 10 CFU (Quebec requires below 200 CFU for swimming). Nitrogen and phosphorus levels surprisingly are at the same levels as previous years.   
* From Paul Hamilton, consulting biologist: “I suspect the increase in milfoil is related to the spring weather conditions (especially light and water temperature) and nutrients in the sediments. The good news is your nutrient levels do not seem to be bad at all (therefore the washed-in sediments are likely mainly inorganic particles).  Stressing the plants (harvesting in the late summer, early fall and in the spring) is the best way to control the growth. Also, poor weather conditions can do the same. For example the water clarity problem you report has two sides, 1\) a problem with more nutrients in the lake (with possible blue-green algae) and 2\) the visibility will stress the milfoil which may help to control the milfoil later this year (and possibly next year ?) .”

**Usher Lake August 15, 2024 summary**
  
* Usher continues to have high nutrient and bacteria levels, with e-coli at 110 CFU [at location 11](https://lacnotredame.org/map/maps/) (below the 200 CFU limit for swimming but well above drinking water recommendations). 

Phosphorus levels at location 11 have been higher than the target level of 0.01 mg/l of an uncontaminated lake for the last 5 years. The higher nitrogen and phosphorus levels are somewhat expected given the small size of Usher, but do increase the risk of toxic Blue-Green Algae.

## Weed team report \- presented by Jane Hayward

Two mornings of work by team volunteers in July yielded a significant collection, now decomposing on Jane’s property. Special thanks to Ken and his tractor for moving them from the boat launch.

While we enjoyed the community effort, it's clear that managing the weeds ourselves will be a massive undertaking. To continue with volunteers and manual cutting, we would need to invest in tools and methods:

1. Improved booms: $15 noodle-based boom showed promise, but we need a much larger setup.  
2. Two-canoe apparatus: Robert shared ideas from the camp, using a setup between two canoes   
3. Flat-fronted boat (like a Jon boat) with an electric motor for more effective removal.  
4. More equipment: Large rakes and collection mats are essential but costly.  
5. We must shift the lake's culture to prevent milfoil spread through a public awareness campaign.  
6. Explore and pilot-test alternatives, including getting ministry permission for non-manual methods  
   * William Hebert will contact Quebec government re permissions.   
   * Question on whether or not to pull up weeds. Yes, manually pulling up the weeds by the roots is more effective than cutting for small areas.  Easiest in shallow water, equipment available at CanadianPond.  Should be done only in early spring or after mid-July after spawning season. Try not to disturb the bottom too much to reduce dispersion of sediment.

### 7.0 Proposed Association program for 2024-2025 with motions

 Weed Management

**Motion: Based on the pilot, move to create a separate Management fund of up to $10,000  for managing shared areas/channels after July 15 end of fish spawning season. Any funds tagged for this fund would be pre-approved to spend on managing the shared areas of the lake shown in the image below. Do a Fundraising drive.** 

- Moved: Graeme Simpson
- Seconded: Lauren Osmond
- Vote: Pass

Update membership fees

Historically the fee was $20, reduced to $10 during the weed-free years.   
**Motion  to increase the annual membership fees to $25 per year to reflect the increased costs of the association** for basic expenses of buoys, web site, Entreprise Quebec and water testing. Donations to the milfoil management fund may reduce overall donations, which have been covering the gap between fees and expenses.

- Seconded by: Imre Rohonczy  
- Vote: Passed  
  Note: all boaters using the Bishop's Manor Association gate will be required to join the association

Change  the timing of the AGM

The Board recommends moving the timing of the AGM to avoid peak summer season.  The timing of the AGM has been timed to correspond to the water testing results. Given the emergent millfoil issue, the moving of the AGM earlier on would allow the Association to respond quicker and better to this issue. Generally we will aim for the first Saturday after the July long weekend.

**Move to schedule the 2025 AGM on July 5, 2025**

Marie Maisonneuve stepped down. Thank you to Marie for her long service to the Association.

2025 program includes amending and updating [Association bylaws](https://lacnotredame.org/assets/docs/Association\_By-Laws\_en.pdf), which have not been updated in the last 10 years.

9.0 Members open issues

**Awareness campaign**: Members need to help the board by contacting their neighbours to join the association and share the learning. We could print up some flyers prior to the July AGM,, and get a list of members/non-members ready so members can consult the list and sign-up for non-member properties that they could approach to join.   
Marcel will assist in handing out flyers. 

**Water levels**: In response to a question about getting water levels lower since the huge rains this month,  Imre shared that he and the dam team have been removing portions of the dam since the beavers returned in early August. His comments:

* *As per Quebec Ministry of Forestry, Wildlife & Park* and *Local Municipal Regulations*, Imre and the team are only permitted to slowly remove portions of the dam to prevent flooding and damage to  the ecological sensitive wetlands downstream from the rush of silt. Trespassing to destroy the dam risks flooding, and potential damage to Chemin Kalalla (although the new culvert should reduce this possibility)*.* Trail cameras and no trespassing signs are in place.  
* All of the dam team members have now signed agreements, and have "agent status" on the property, and can act on behalf of the owners with regards to the Trespass Act. A measuring stick in the water near the dam is used by the team to monitor water levels.   
* Beaver families come and go in cycles. The water level can end up very low if the dam is partially opened and the beavers don’t return or are unskilled juveniles, like this year. When the dam is rebuilt and we have a lot of rain, the beavers will keep building as the water rises. Unfortunately once the water is up and very high,  it will take a while to go back down.   
* Lisa added that half of the emails she receives are about too-high water levels, and half are about too-low levels \- sometimes at the same time\! People should be aware it’s a big lake with a single outlet, not a managed waterway. Docks should be designed accordingly.
