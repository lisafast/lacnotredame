### Budget plans / Plans budgétaires

Your membership fees support the following budget for the upcoming year: 

* Water testing approximately $600 per year
* $400 of Buoys and anchors due to extensive milfoil and replacements of lost/aging buoys

* Quebec non-profit corporation fees ($35/year)
* Domain name and hosting fees for the web site ($30 every second year)
* Facility rental for annual meeting: $100 
* Good news - the Association received over $1,400 in donations this summer (2023) which will go towards this budget.

## Water testing report

[Water testing report](/water/qualityreports/) presented by Lisa Fast

* Thank you to Carole Doré, Denis Corbeil and Rejean Vaillant for their continued volunteer work on water testing. Water testing samples on Lac Notre Dame and Usher were collected August 16. 
  
Lac Notre Dame August 16th, 2023 summary:

* E-coli levels are generally low, with 6 of 8 locations almost undetectable. 
* Exceptions are [Location 4](/map/maps/), between Generations and Symons very high at 230 CFU/100ml - swimming is not recommended above 200 CFU, drinking water should have 0. [Location 6](/map/maps/)at Generations was also higher than the rest of the lake at 66.
* E-coli levels in the Water may be impacted by pond water, construction and/or otters (there isevidence of their use of lake where creek comes out). 

* Recommendation: Lisa to report the e-coli levels to the municipality given the recurrent e-coli results near locations 4 and 6 over the years. 

**Question from the floor** Do we send out flyer/ advise people? Lisa will email.

**Action**: plan to test twice in July 2024: e-coli only

* Phosphorus is back down to quite low levels (this is good!), and nitrogen levels are within the usual range. Water clarity amidst the heavy August rains was lower than usual.

* **Usher Lake August 16th, 2023 summary:** E-coli levels in Usher Lake range from 10 to 26, which is better than many previous years. High levels of phosphates are seen at both inlets, which may increase the risk of blue-green algae. 

* Recommendation: Usher lake property owners should watch for and report any possible Blue-Green slicks (floats and looks like paint on the water surface)

## Water level report

* Water levels were unusually low May through July because no beavers had yet dammed the outlet. This likely contributed to greater milfoil growth. Beavers then began damming in late July  and with constant rain, levels rose to slightly higher than usual August levels. This helps keep the weediest parts of the lake navigable and reduces sunlight to weeds. 
* Imre and the dam team volunteers (Marcel, Graeme and Denis) have been removing parts of the dam on an almost weekly basis. They manage removal carefully as there is a wetland and road that must be protected behind the dam, and extensive regulations to follow.  
* no cost
* thanks to dam team

## Board report on program that had been planned for 2022-2023

* Buoys: We purchased additional anchors, rope and buoys. Buoys were added later at the west Island channel and bay at the Du Domaine causeway. They were moved as the weed mats grew. 
* Signs: We purchased signs warning to stay away from the buoys. The design is based on La Peche designs. We placed them on roads, docks, on the island and at the weediest points in the lake. The signs will be removed in the fall and re-used. 
** sign font is too small, next time make them larger
* Milfoil: We investigated the status of the cutter purchased back in 2004, and attempted to arrange a cutting morning in mid-August. Unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate. A few letters were delivered to property owners asking them to please stop boating at high speed through the weed-choked island channel.  
* Water testing: samples were collected and clarity tests conducted on August 16. 
* In-person board meeting: Rupert Community Centre wasn't available this year, so trying here at Camp Kalalla. Cost $100. Let us know your thoughts. 
* Missed this: Problem with someone cutting weeds without raking, and so many floated in - we could drop a hand-out next summer - have someone in each area walk them around - Bernard and Susan on Shaw volunteer to do that for their area
