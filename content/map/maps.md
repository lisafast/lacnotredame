## Association water testing locations

The red-numbered locations in the lakes on the map show where water samples are collected for testing.  Most locations match where water is either entering or exiting the lakes.

This map was created by Steve Hume from the Full Size Electoral map for La Pêche  (large PDF file takes a while to load). [http://www.villelapeche.qc.ca/en/municipality/about/electoral-map/](http://www.villelapeche.qc.ca/en/municipality/about/electoral-map/)
